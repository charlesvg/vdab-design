# Using Lerna
- Change some code
- Commit it (locally)
- Run `lerna version`

# Local development
- Change some code
- Run `npm run watch` for each component you are editing
- Run 'npm run start' for the mockup you are working on

# TODO
- Improve/avoid webpack generating an auxiliary asset for the awesome-app.css file (maybe https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34039826/webpack-style-loader-vs-css-loader)
- Take a hard look at size optimizations, both for lit & webpack
